    "The latest research has found that 77 percent of adults in the United States drink coffee on a daily basis. Depending on the price you charge for a cup of coffee, your target market may be students and business workers on their way to work or class.\n",
    "2. #### Coffee Shop Lovers\n",
    "People who spend time at shops and cafes where specialty drinks and regular cups of coffee are available along with an inviting atmosphere â€“ rather than coming in to grab a cup of coffee.\n",
    "3. #### Specialty Coffee Drinkers\n",
    "Espressos, cappuccinos, lattes, and mochas are just the start, if you want to sell specialty coffee drinks. The target market for this coffee product consists of those who love specific ingredients in their coffee-based beverage.\n",
    "4. #### Whole Bean Buyers\n",
    "Another target market consists of people who buy whole bean coffee to make at home or in the office. These buyers ask to have the beans ground in the store, or they grind the coffee themselves, for the freshest cup possible. This audience buys whole beans by the pound in different flavors from various regions."
